# Capbeep
Capbeep is a lightweight utility intended to periodically and unintrusively report if your caps lock is turned on. Simply download the file and run it. If you turn your caps lock on, a short beep will be heard every 1 second (1000 MS). To exit the application, left click on the system tray icon. To view the program's context menu, right click the system tray icon. From here, you can change the beep interval to a custom value (in milliseconds), or exit the program. This program is entirely standalone and portable, needing no extra dependencies to run. The only trace it leaves behind is a .ini file.
